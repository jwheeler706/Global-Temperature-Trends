# GISS Surface Temperature Analysis

This directory contains several datasets from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis, which is an estimate of global surface temperature change.  These datasets are updated monthly; the newest versions of the dataset can be found at https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ .  The four datasets include surface temperatures averaged over the entire globe, the northern or southern hemisphere, or zonal averages (i.e., broken up by bands of latitude).  The data is stored as **temperature anomalies,** which is to say deviations from the average temperature from 1951-1980.  The datasets include temperature data from 1880 to the present day.  Datasets are:

Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present:  GLB.Ts+dSST.csv

Northern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present:  NH.Ts+dSST.csv

Southern Hemisphere-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present:  SH.Ts+dSST.csv

Zonal annual means, 1880-present:  ZonAnn.Ts+dSST.csv
